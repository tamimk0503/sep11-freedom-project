## Starting to use my tool (Melon) 11/9/22


The tool I started working on was Melon.JS as going through the list containing many tools we could use such as Firebase, React.JS, Kaboom, etc I saw Melon.JS being the best fit.
For context, this year's freedom project is about making something functional using Javascript which from there I decided that I wanted to work on a game but more specifically a platformer that is focused on speed and platforming just like the sonic games as those games were very significant to me growing up. With that idea, I saw Melon.JS being the best fit because it targeted making platformers compared to something like Kaboom which yes is also made for games but Melon was more specific thus I chose Melon.JS over the other choices. Recently I have been trying to learn Melon through their [platformer tutorial](https://melonjs.org/tutorial/) in which I mostly modified some of the values such as the friction, speed, and jump power but I did skim over some of the code in which I saw most of it is completely foreign to me because of the code looking something like this `me. audio.play("die", false);` but eventually I will understand what it means. After that tutorial, I plan on doing the [Space Invaders tutorial](http://melonjs.github.io/tutorial-space-invaders/) as it seems more in line with an actual tutorial. For my Engineering Design Process, I've defined my problem which would be what my idea would be for the Freedom Project which will be making a fast-paced platformer and the other being research the problem which makes the game will be accomplished by using Melon.JS but for me to use it I would have to learn and understand to make the game. For skills, I used how to learn as I have to learn Melon.JS to make my game and how to read as learning Melon.JS requires me to read the documentation to understand.
