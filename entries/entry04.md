Alongside with learning MelonJS I had started to learn Tiled as it is used for making maps for 2d games it is something MelonJS works with and it is something I would need to accomplish to make different maps. In tiled they have json files for the maps with them also using something called tilesets for the sprites like the ground or water used in the the platformer example but I wasn't quite sure on how to use it. That was until I had searched it on google just to see and saw original [tutorial](http://melonjs.github.io/tutorial-platformer/#part1)
