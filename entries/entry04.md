Alongside with learning MelonJS I had started to learn Tiled as it is a free, open-source software that allows people to create tile maps for their games it is something MelonJS works with and it is something I would need to accomplish to make different maps. In tiled they have json files for the maps with them also using something called tilesets for the sprites like the ground or water used in the the platformer example but I wasn't quite sure on how to use it. That was until I had searched it on google just to see and saw the original [tutorial](http://melonjs.github.io/tutorial-platformer/#part1) in which it mentioned how to use tilted to make a level but it didn't mention much about tilesets in which I was going to do research on but it isn't necessarily important as it is something beyond MVP and I can use the pre-existing ones given by the tutorial for my game. However there is the part that I saw from the example when I opened it up on tiled in where it parts like `me.Trigger` as shown from the screenshot below.

As I looked through the tutorial I saw this [part](http://melonjs.github.io/tutorial-platformer/#part8) which helped as going through my original code didn't show an instance of using it besides in the JSON file of the maps themselves which I found weird but it makes sense looking at how it is done in this tutorial. Alongside with `mainPlayer` as it is where the player would spawn in which it helped me with.Besides working on Tiled I had attempted to work on something MelonJS which more specifically on making the coin make you faster for a set time as I had made some progress towards this but I believe it should be something outside of MVP as I need to make a platformer first then add special things to it like mentioned before like my own tileset to make a level look more unique than it is as it uses the platformer example. For working on the MVP I did add a new level alongside the pre-existing ones
