# Entry 6
##### 6/4/23

### Expo Elevator Pitch
A takeaway I got from the elevator pitch was that I should have stayed more with the script I had made as I realized that I was missing some of the key points from my [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yvirL1cxJWQj6FT8X-sx_Mx7I7i1fJkKbmW5lQOpq7M/edit?usp=sharing) such as the inspiration and the controls. In addition I felt like I should have added more functionality to things such as the exclamation mark block as people assumed that like mario when you hit it then an item appeared which wasn't the case for mine.

### In-Class presentation
A takeaway I had from the presentation is in a sense similar to the Expo with that I should have ideas on what I should say as during the presentation there were moments of where I had puased in which I wasn't qutie sure on what to say in which I was shaking a little bit but I had managed to got through but besides that and visual things like making things easier to see I overrall did good. Here are my [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_224J-Z4QyLEgKxnFFywluZAhGaiFZrA/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103409622872672510130&rtpof=true&sd=true) in which you can see with things like the code that it may be hard to see from far away.


### EDP(Engineering Design Process) & Skills
THe stage I am currently for EDP is communicating the results as all of this is over with me working on the project to presentating in class and the expo and me telling whoever the reader is my perspective on this with things I can improve for next year. As for skills I used consideration as I had recently worked on my blog overview which was mostly implication in which I had to type the impact my project would have on a global, social, and economical way and the second skill would have to be growth mindset as from this experience I have to improve for next year for when I take APCSA with all the takeaways I have gotten throughout this year.
