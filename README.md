# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Tamim Kabir

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about learning and using that and applying it to a product which in our case had to be something in Javascript which had to be interactive. The purpose of this blog is to show and explain where I was at the time making the game.

## Content
For my project, I am making a fast-paced platformer. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Melon.JS in order to make the game.

## Implications
The game that I created has impacts on society with them being global, social, and economic. For global it has an impact as it serves as a time waster as it is on a device be it on a phone or computer in which the enviorment is used and stripped for its resources to make those things but from that it let us make our lives easier and allows us to do many things. For the social aspect as it has the potential to create bonds with others and a community discussing the game. Lastly for economic it has the potential to be monitize similar to mobile games but outside of the game itself as if the game has a community having something like a merch shop could bring in some money.
